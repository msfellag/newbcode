# newbcode

The goal of this page is to become a roadmap to learning/practicing programming
in many languages (Python, C#, C, JS ..etc) using free online resources
and most importantly to have small projects you can accomplish following
each theoretical lesson in order to fully (or at least better) assimilate
the concepts learned.

At first this will be mostly a revival of the repo "rby90/project-based-tutorials-in-c "

as well as a curated list of video lectures and small explanations.

[Note to self : Show don't tell, the above part should be removed once the work is done and the links ought-to be placed in an attribution section?]

TBD :
Retro programming (C, BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, DOS, UNIX) :
- [ ] retro books from Archive.org
- [ ] retro VHS training tapes

C programming roadmap/pathway
- [ ] A video edited version of the [Stanford CS107 video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9D558D49CA734A02)
- [ ] A video edited version of the [ops-class.org video lectures](https://ops-class.org)

DSA: Algorithms & Data Structure
- [ ] Robert Sedgewick Algo 1 & 2 from back when Coursera was not awful [Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9diDWV-fOnE)

Building a toy GPT mostly a playlist of Andrej Karpathy and ML from Andrew Ng' youtube videos at this point ? 
+ non-technical intro by Cassie Kozyrkov

- [ ] [Making Friends with Machine Learning: The Entire Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vkb7BCMQd0)
- [ ] [Let's build the GPT Tokenizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE)

NTS : Archiving the videos ? Should it be done? is it legal? dunno, figure it out please. 

Other resources off the top of my head :
Computerphile (current + historical stuff, when a byte came to be 8bit etc...)
Buffer0verflow channel

samsclass : https://samsclass.info/ (basic security stuff with the most ASMRish voice in the world)

Test embedding a youtube player ?

Music section :
This mad rambling was facilitated greatly by listening to the 1987 album Chet Baker in Tokyo.
